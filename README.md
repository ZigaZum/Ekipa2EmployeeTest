I got instructions for iOS but i figured it was ok for Android too. Everithing is set up for release (proguard rules, gradle.properties, new launch icon) there is ony the need for a keystore for signing the application.

For the last screen with the search results I didn't know witch method you prefere so I made both. One is calling a search api and receving the results allready in a json. The second method is by getting html page from google and parsing it to Document and then getting the appropriate tag (h3).

Thank you for the oportunity and I hope to hear from you soon.
